    <p>My pet is a dog named <strong>Gafi</strong>.Gafi is an adorable brown dog that has a few white spots spread on his body
      . Gafi is a Golden Retriever crossed with a border collie, and he has fluffy velvety ears. Even though he has a very strong body frame, he has a very gentle face and is always a friendly dog to those whom he knows. If a stranger approaches out house, however, Gafi can get very aggressive. He always barks loudly to attract our attention to the approaching stranger.

     <p>He loves many things. Among these is to nuzzle his wet nose in my hands and in the hands on my parents and siblings. He craves attention most of the time because he is scared of being abandoned or ignored.</p>


     <p>He loves food, especially bones. Once we have fed him his regular food, we always give him a few bones on which to chew. Tipsy can actually spend whole afternoons chewing bones because he loves them so much. Whenever he is worried, he looks at us with desperate eyes that appear like he is sad. He does so while wagging his tail from one side to the other. Whenever we see him exhibiting these signs, we immediately prepare him a quick meal and some bones for him to eat.</p>


    <p>He  also likes the chirping sound made by the birds that reside on the trees in our compound. Whenever he hears these sounds, he raises his ears and points them towards the direction where the chirping sound is originating. One can always observe the way his eyes light up with excitement whenever the birds begin making their soothing noises.</p>
